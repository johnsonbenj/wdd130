    <p>My wife and I have been married 30+ years.  We really have a great life</p>
    <p>We both work as teachers/ online instructors.  She works for a online high school
        I work for BYU-Idaho and and a local middle school. I love BYU-Idaho because I get to
        meet so many different people.  I've met people from all over the world.  It's been great.  
        I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ my whole life.  In fact I'm a 7th generation member.  
        That's pretty cool, but I also had to be converted myself the same as everyone.  At some point we all 
        have to chose if we believe it or not, right?  I do.  I have a testimony of my Savior Jesus Christ.
